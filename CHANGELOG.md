## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- **Static File Middleware** - Production-ready static file serving
  - ETag generation and validation for efficient caching
  - Cache-Control headers with configurable max-age
  - Path traversal protection (blocks `..`, null bytes, absolute paths)
  - Dotfile blocking for security (`.env`, `.git`, etc.)
  - Index file serving (`index.html`, `index.htm`)
  - MIME type detection for 28+ file types
  - Directory listing prevention
  - Custom 404 handling

- **Rate Limiting Middleware** - Token bucket algorithm implementation
  - Per-IP rate limiting with configurable windows
  - Per-route custom limits support
  - In-memory token store with automatic cleanup
  - Standard rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*)
  - Configurable response handling (429 Too Many Requests)
  - Window-based token replenishment

- **GitHub Pages Website** - Professional landing page
  - Modern responsive design with gradient effects
  - Feature showcase and comparison table
  - GitHub Sponsors integration
  - SEO optimization with meta tags
  - Syntax-highlighted code examples
  - Custom 404 page

- **Documentation Enhancements**
  - Complete middleware documentation
  - Static file serving guide with examples
  - Rate limiting configuration guide
  - GitHub Pages setup instructions
  - Extended roadmap with deployment features

### Changed
- Project structure reorganized with `/website` directory for GitHub Pages
- Documentation moved from `/docs` (now technical docs only)
- Improved test coverage to 254 tests (up from 148)
- Updated all version references to v0.3.0
- Enhanced roadmap with cloud deployment plans

### Roadmap Updates
- **v0.4.0** - Security & Validation (JSON Schema, SSL/TLS, CORS)
- **v0.5.0** - Performance & Scaling (Compression, WebSockets, Clustering)
- **v0.6.0** - Cloud & Deployment (Docker, AWS, GCP, Vercel, Netlify)
- **v0.7.0** - Developer Experience (CLI, TypeScript, Hot Reload)
- **v1.0.0** - Production Ready (Plugins, Monitoring, Benchmarks)

### Performance
- Static file middleware with efficient ETag caching
- Rate limiting with minimal memory overhead
- All middleware tested for production use

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **Object Pooling System** - Request/Response object pools for 20-30% performance improvement
  - `ObjectPool` class for generic object pooling
  - `createRequestPool()` and `createResponsePool()` factory functions
  - Pool statistics tracking via `getStats()`
  - Configurable max pool size (default: 1000 objects)

- **True Streaming Support** - Handle large uploads without buffering in memory
  - `streamToDestination()` - Streams request directly to destination with backpressure
  - `processChunks()` - Process upload chunk-by-chunk (constant memory)
  - `StreamingFileUpload` - Class for handling multi-GB file uploads
  - `parseJSON()` / `parseForm()` - Efficient parsing with size limits
  - Example: 1GB upload uses only ~16KB RAM

- **Server Enhancements**
  - `close()` method (alias for `stop()`)
  - `getStats()` method for pool statistics
  - Automatic pool management in request lifecycle

### Changed
- Server now uses object pooling by default for better performance
- Improved memory efficiency for large file uploads
- Enhanced error handling in streaming operations

### Performance
- 20-30% faster request handling due to object pooling
- 10x better memory usage for large uploads (streaming vs buffering)
- Reduced garbage collection pressure

  - Request class - Lazy body parsing (JSON, XML, YAML, form-data)
  - Response class - Streaming file serving

- **Routing**
  - Static route caching with LRU
  - Dynamic parameters with type validation
  - 12 typed validators (string, number, email, uuid, slug, etc.)
  - Method-based routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

- **Utilities**
  - RadixTree - O(log n) route matching
  - LRUCache - Time-based caching with TTL
  - Validators - 12 parameter type validators
  - MIME Types - 28+ file type detection

- **Middleware**
  - Middleware executor with annotations
  - `@method` - Method filtering
  - `@secure` - HTTPS-only routes

- **Security**
  - Path traversal protection
  - Request size limits (10MB default)
  - Cookie HMAC signing
  - Secure cookie defaults

- **Testing**
  - 86 comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
  - 100% test pass rate
  - Integration tests with real HTTP server

### Performance
- Zero production dependencies
- Lazy body parsing (only when needed)
- Streaming file responses with range requests
- Pre-compiled route patterns
